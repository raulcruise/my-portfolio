      <h2 class="sectiontitle">Background Information</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a rising junior at California State Universtity, Fullerton.
        My interest in computers began in middle school but I've only
        begun coding recently when I took an online class the summer
        before I began college.

      <h2 class="sectiontitle">Computer Building</h2>
      <p>
        Recently I have been building many of my friends' gaming computers
        for them. To me, it's almost like putting together a huge puzzle
        except I know where each piece has to go. Yet that doesn't take
        away any satisfaction from seeing the end result. I always know
        roughly how the computer will look but I always love seeing the
        result that has come out of my work.
